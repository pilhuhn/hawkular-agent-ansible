= Ansible module for WildFly with Hawkular-agent

This playbook distributes WildFly servers to machines
in the `wildfly-servers` inventory group. Those
servers will be equipped with the Hawkular agent and
automatically be configured.

It currently assumes that the following list of
items is already present in the directory:

* agent-installer-0.10.1.Final-SNAPSHOT.jar -- the agent installer
* hawkular-monitor-0.10.1.Final-SNAPSHOT-module.zip -- the agent itself
* wildfly-10.0.0.CR2.tar.gz -- the WildFly server to use

You can tune the versions in the `vars` section of `install_agent.yml`.
